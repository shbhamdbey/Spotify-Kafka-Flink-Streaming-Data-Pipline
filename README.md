### Prerequisites

* Docker Desktop or a compatible alternative (Podman, Rancher Desktop, OrbStack, containerd) [cite: 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629]
* Spotify API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) [cite: 682, 683, 684]
* Pinecone account and API key [cite: 732]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  Set up environment variables (Spotify API credentials, Pinecone API key, etc.).
3.  Build and run the services using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

## Architecture

The system architecture is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file and comprises the following services:

* **Zookeeper:** For Kafka cluster management. [cite: 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655]
   
* **Kafka:** The message broker for handling track play events. [cite: 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649, 650, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 658, 659, 660, 661, 662, 663, 664]

* **Flink JobManager:** Coordinates the Flink jobs. [cite: 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679]
